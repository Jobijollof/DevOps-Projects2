### ANSIBLE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT ‚Äì AUTOMATE PROJECT 7 TO 10

In Projects 7 to 10 a lot of manual operations was used  to set up virtual servers, install and configure required software and deploy web application.

This Project will open our minds to appreciate DevOps tools even more by making most of the routine tasks automated with [Ansible Configuration Management,](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-configuration-management#:~:text=Configuration%20management%20is%20a%20process,in%20a%20desired%2C%20consistent%20state.&text=Managing%20IT%20system%20configurations%20involves,building%20and%20maintaining%20those%20systems.) at the same time bolster confidence at writing code using declarative language such as YAML.

Let us get started! üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

A [Jump Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server) (sometimes also referred as [Bastion Host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host)) is an intermediary server through which access to internal network can be provided. If you think about the current architecture you are working on, ideally, the webservers would be inside a secured network which cannot be reached directly from the Internet. 
That means, even DevOps engineers cannot SSH into the Web servers directly and can only access it through a Jump Server ‚Äì it provide better security and reduces [attack surface.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface)
On the diagram below the Virtual Private Network (VPC) is divided into [two subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html) ‚Äì Public subnet has public IP addresses and Private subnet is only reachable by private IP addresses.

Project 15, will expose our learning to a Bastion host in proper action. But for now, we will develop Ansible scripts to simulate the use of a Jump box/Bastion host to access our Web Servers.

### Task:

- Install and configure Ansible client to act as a Jump Server/Bastion Host

- Create a simple Ansible playbook to automate servers configuration

## INSTALL AND CONFIGURE ANSIBLE ON EC2 INSTANCE

Update Name tag on your Jenkins EC2 Instance to Jenkins-Ansible. We will use this server to run playbooks.

- In your GitHub account create a new repository and name it ansible-config-mgt.

- Install Ansible

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt install ansible`

- Check your Ansible version by running

![version](./images/ansible-version1.png)

`ansible --version`

Configure Jenkins build job to save your repository content every time you change it ‚Äì this will solidify your Jenkins configuration skills acquired in Project 9.

- Create a new Freestyle project ansible in Jenkins and point it to your ‚Äòansible-config-mgt‚Äô repository.

- Configure Webhook in GitHub and set webhook to trigger ansible build.

- Configure a Post-build job to save all (**) files, like you did it in Project 9.

- Test your setup by making some change in README.MD file in master branch and make sure that builds starts automatically and Jenkins saves the files (build artifacts) in following folder
ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build_number>/archive/

Note: Trigger Jenkins project execution only for /main (master) branch.

Follow the steps [here](https://github.com/Jobijollof/DevOps-Projects/blob/main/Project%209%20Introduction%20to%20Jenkins/README.md) to setup Jenkins.  

After creating your first free style project, do the following,

- Click on configure on the left

- Click on git source code management and place the Url of Ansible-config-mgt repo

![config](./images/ansible-3.png)

![config](./images/master-4.png)

![config](./images/build-trigger5.png)

![config](./images/post-build-6.png)

- Click on build now

![config](./images/7.png)

- Errors

![config](./images/error-8.png)

- Error message

![config](./images/ansible-9.png)

- Go back to configure and make this change

![config](./images/ansible-10.png)

- Successful build

![config](./images/ansible-11.png)

Now your setup will look like this:

![ansible](./images/ansible-diagram2.png)

- Trigger a change in the repo Ansible-config-mgt. Edit the README.md

observation build wasnt triggered automatically i have to still build manaually.

***Tip*** Every time you stop/start your Jenkins-Ansible server ‚Äì you have to reconfigure GitHub webhook to a new IP address, in order to avoid it, it makes sense to allocate an Elastic IP to your Jenkins-Ansible server (This was done in Project 10). Note that Elastic IP is free only when it is being allocated to an EC2 Instance, so do not forget to release Elastic IP once you terminate your EC2 Instance.

By default, the artifacts are stored on the Jenkins server locally to check that,

```
ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/job-name/builds/build_number/archive/

ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/project-tooling/builds/3/archive/

```

## BEGIN ANSIBLE DEVELOPMENT

In your ansible-config-mgt GitHub repository, create a new branch that will be used for development of a new feature.

- Tip: Give your branches descriptive and comprehensive names, for example, if you use Jira or Trello as a project management tool ‚Äì include ticket number (e.g. PRJ-145) in the
name of your branch and add a topic and a brief description what this branch is about ‚Äì a bugfix, hotfix, feature, release (e.g. feature/prj-145-lvm)

- Checkout the newly created feature branch to your local machine and start building your code and directory structure

- Create a directory and name it playbooks ‚Äì it will be used to store all your playbook files.

- Create a directory and name it inventory ‚Äì it will be used to keep your hosts organised.

- Within the playbooks folder, create your first playbook, and name it common.yml

- Within the inventory folder, create an inventory file (.yml) for each environment (Development, Staging Testing and Production) dev, staging, uat, and prod respectively.



Step 4 ‚Äì Set up an Ansible Inventory
An Ansible inventory file defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate. Since our intention is to execute Linux commands on remote hosts, and ensure that it is the intended configuration on a particular server that occurs. It is important to have a way to organize our hosts in such an Inventory.
Save below inventory structure in the inventory/dev file to start configuring your development servers. Ensure to replace the IP addresses according to your own setup.
Note: Ansible uses TCP port 22 by default, which means it needs to ssh into target servers from Jenkins-Ansible host ‚Äì for this you can implement the concept of ssh-agent. Now you need to import your key into ssh-agent:
